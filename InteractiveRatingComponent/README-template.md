## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- HTML


### What I learned

I learned to better organize my code, to be more agile, and while visualizing the project's design, already thinking of strategies to implement it. An important thing to note is that this was my first project with Javascript. I tried to do it in the best possible way, but I believe I can still improve a lot.
